## Welcome!

This is our landing page for our Fall course **MUSA 550: Geospatial Data Science with Python**.

On the left handside, you will find information about the syllabus, assignments, lectures and other important material. New material will be added every week. This course goes at a relatively fast pace. Don't fall behind.

Many many thanks to **Nick Hand**! who developed this entire website and codes.
